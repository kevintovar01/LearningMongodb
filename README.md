# LearningMongoDB


---

### ✨ Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm currently learning **MongoDB** to use in my future projects and unlock their full potential.\
I started exploring NoSQL databases because I realized that traditional **SQL databases** may not be ideal for certain types of projects I have in mind.

I mean that as an app or product grows — possibly reaching millions of users — a relational database like **SQL** might face scalability issues.

Although I can still build many of my ideas using **PostgreSQL**, for platforms like **social media** or **e-commerce apps**, it's often better to use a **NoSQL database** because they tend to be more scalable and flexible in handling unstructured data.

That being said, in this repository, I’ll also be creating a **full API using PostgreSQL**, since it’s still a powerful and reliable choice for many other kinds of applications.

### 🧠 What I'm learning now:

- Advanced MongoDB features (Aggregation, Indexing, etc.)

---

### 💡 Future goals:

- Build scalable backend systems
- Learn GraphQL
- Deploy full-stack apps

🚀 Let's Connect or Collaborate!

I'm always open to learning new things and improving my skills. If you have useful resources, suggestions, or even project ideas that could help me grow as a developer — feel free to share them!

If you're working on something exciting or have a product idea in mind, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe we can build something great together.

For example, it could be a startup idea, a community tool, or even just a fun app. I'm eager to collaborate and bring ideas to life! 👀

### 📚 How I Started Learning MongoDB

I began learning MongoDB by watching a YouTube video and reading through a helpful page that summarizes key concepts quickly:

```bash

▶️ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2M-rlkkT5o
```

To get started, I installed `mongosh` on my Arch Linux system using the following command:

```bash
yay -Sy mongodb-bin
```

Once installed, you can connect to MongoDB with:

```bash
mongosh
```

At this point, I encountered a common issue — MongoDB wasn't running yet. To fix this, you need to start the MongoDB service with the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mongodb
sudo systemctl enable mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

Now MongoDB is up and running and ready to use! 🚀
