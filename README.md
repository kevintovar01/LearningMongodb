# LearningMongoDB


---

### ✨ Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm currently learning **MongoDB** to use in my future projects and unlock their full potential.\
I started exploring NoSQL databases because I realized that traditional **SQL databases** may not be ideal for certain types of projects I have in mind.

I mean that as an app or product grows — possibly reaching millions of users — a relational database like **SQL** might face scalability issues.

Although I can still build many of my ideas using **PostgreSQL**, for platforms like **social media** or **e-commerce apps**, it's often better to use a **NoSQL database** because they tend to be more scalable and flexible in handling unstructured data.

That being said, in this repository, I’ll also be creating a **full API using PostgreSQL**, since it’s still a powerful and reliable choice for many other kinds of applications.

### 💡 Future goals:

- Build scalable backend systems
- Learn GraphQL

I'm always open to learning new things and improving my skills. If you have useful resources, suggestions, or even project ideas that could help me grow as a developer — feel free to share them!

If you're working on something exciting or have a product idea in mind, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe we can build something great together.

For example, it could be a startup idea, a community tool, or even just a fun app. I'm eager to collaborate and bring ideas to life! 👀
